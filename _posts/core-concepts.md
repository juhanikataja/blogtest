<!-- # Simplified architecture of the rahti okd cluster --> 
<!-- The [OKD](https://www.okd.io) is a distribution of kubernetes (The Origin Community Distribution of Kubernetes that powers RedHat OpenShift). Because OKD is contained in RedHat's OpenShift, we might speak about Openshift and OKD interchangeably, but strictly speaking they are different platforms. Sometimes, if we get wildly colloquial, we might even abandon camel casing and say 'openshift'! -->
<!--  -->
<!-- Pretty good working definition of openshift is: -->
<!--  -->
<!-- >Openshift is a multi-tenant container orchestration and management tool. -->
<!--  -->
<!-- Basically, what openshift does for you is that it -->
<!--  -->
<!-- 1. Runs your container images -->
<!-- 2. Stores your container images -->
<!-- 3. Builds your container images -->
<!-- 4. Follows changes in your container images -->
<!-- 5. Routes network traffic to your container images -->
<!--  -->
<!-- Openshift is managed using web dashboard or, better yet, command line tool called `oc`. If you've seen kuberentes, well `oc` is the openshift variant of `kubectl`. The web dashboard of rahti countainer cluster is located at https://rahti.csc.fi/. -->
<!--  -->
<!-- For storing your container images, rahti okd cluster comes along with an internal docker registry that is also managed using a web console or a with the docker's CLI tool `docker`. The registry integrated in rahti is located at http://rahti-console.csc.fi/. -->

# Handmade app in openshift utilizing core concepts

Here we walk through the core concepts of Kubernetes in the form of static http server example. We create the application only using `oc` command line tool and YAML description of its parts.

In this example, a apache http server is started from image included in openshift by default and the server is exposed at myservice-my-project-with-unique-name-123.rahtiapp.fi. Note that you need to edit the applications hostname accordingly in order to avoid name clashes.

In simplest possible case we need

1. Pod that runs the container
2. Service that exposes the pod internally and gives it a predictable name to refer
3. Route that will expose the Service in 2. to outer world and redirects
   `myservice-staticserve.rahtiapp.fi` to the given service object.

So lets go ahead and define the pod, service and the route manually.

## Projects

To make sure that one is in a suitable project in OKD there is the command `oc projects`:

```bash
$ oc projects
You have access to the following projects and can switch between them with 'oc project <projectname>':

    someone-elses-public-project
  * my-project-with-unique-name-123

Using project "my-project-with-unique-name-123" on server "https://rahti.csc.fi:8443".
```

If there would've not been any suitable project to work in, a new one could've been created with

```bash
$ oc new-project my-project-with-unique-name-123
``` 

The name of the project needs to be unique across rahti container cloud. If you have multiple CSC projects, the description of the project must contain "csc_project: #######", where ####### is the project that should be billed. The description can be included in the `new-project` command as follows

```bash
$ oc new-project my-project-with-unique-name-123 --description='csc_project: #######'
```

## Handmade pod

Pods are objects that keep given number of containers running. If a container dies for some reason, pod will automatically try to run it again.

In our case, the pod will run the container image with the web server.

*`pod.yaml`:*

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: mypod
  labels:
    app: serveapp
    pool: servepod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: serve-cont
    image: "docker-registry.default.svc:5000/openshift/httpd"
```

* `spec.containers[0].image` is the image name that runs inside the container 0 inside the pod. Typically this is populated by openshift deployments or statefulsets.

* `metadata.name` is the name so that the pod can be referred using, e.g., `oc`:

    ```bash
    oc get pods mypod
    ```

* `metadata.labels.pool` is just an arbitrary label so that the pod can be referred by, e.g., *services*.

## Handmade service

Notice that nowhere in the definition of pod there were mentions of its network identity such as IP address or hostname. That is because in Kubernetes, internal communication to pods are set up using *Service* objects:

*`service.yaml`:*
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: serve
  labels:
    app: serveapp
spec:
  ports:
  - name: 8080-tcp
    port: 8080
    protocol: TCP
  selector:
    pool: servepod
```

This service will redirect TCP traffic internally in the project to the pods having labels listed in `spec.selector`. In this case, the service will redirect to all the pods having label `pool: servepod`. If there are multiple pods matching `spec.selector` then traffic is split between pods in a defined way.

## Handmade route

*`route.yaml`:*
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Route
metadata:
  labels:
    app: serveapp
  name: myservice
spec:
  host: myservice-my-project-with-unique-name-123.rahtiapp.fi
  to:
    kind: Service
    name: serve
    weight: 100
```

This route will redirect traffic from internet to service in the cluster having with `metadata.name` being `spec.to.name`.

* Currently `spec.to.kind` must be `Service`.
* If the service `spec.to.name` has multiple ports defined then it might make sense to define `spec.port.targetport`
* By default the hostname is `metadata.name` + `-` + project name + `.rahtiapp.fi` unless otherwise specified in `spec.host`.

So now we have a pod, a service and a route. But what happens if the physical server where the pod happens to live is shut down or, even worse, crashes? ReplicationController object is the tool to remedy just that.

## Handmade ReplicationController

*replicationcontroller.yaml*
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ReplicationController
metadata:
  labels:
    app: serveapp
  name: serveapp-replicator
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    app: serveapp
    pool: servepod
  template:
    metadata:
      name: mypod
      labels:
        app: serveapp
        pool: servepod
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: serve-cont
    image: "docker-registry.default.svc:5000/openshift/httpd"
```

A replication controller ensures that there are `spec.replicas` number of pods running that have all the labels appearing in `spec.selector`. If there are too many, replication controller will shut down the extra and if there are too few, it will start up pods according to `spec.template` field. Actually, the template field is exactly the pod described in `pod.yaml` except the fields `apiVersion` and `kind` are missing.

A central Kubernetes' concept known as *reconciliation* loop manifests replication controllers. Reconciliation loop is a mechanism that measures the *actual state* of the system, constructs *current state* based to the measurement of the system and performs such actions that the state of the system would equal to the *desired state*.

Using such a terminology, replication controllers are objects that describe *desired state* of the cluster. Another such an object is the service object encountered earlier. There is an another reconciliation loop that compares the endpoints of the service the actual pods that are *ready* and adjusts accordingly. As a result, the endpoints of the service always point to pods that are ready and only those pods whose labels contain all the fields in the selector of the service object. In fact, everytime one sees `spec.` in a YAML representation of an object, that is a specification for a reconciliation loop. The loop for pods just happens to be tied to so called *kubelet* daemon that runs on the kubernetes node. (TODO: mik√§ on kubernetes node?)

## Conclusion

Creating applications using pods is useful in terms of understanding the basic components of Kubernetes but it is not encouraged to utilize kubernetes based container clouds this way. Instead, one should at least define a ReplicationController that will keep alive requested amount of replicas of pods defined in the ReplicationController template.

However, using Service and Route objects in the fashion described above is a sufficient design in most cases.

# Handmade app using openshift extensions

In this example we'll explore creating the `serveapp` using OpenShifts extensions `DeploymentConfig`, `ImageStream` and `BuildConfig`. Using these three object types, one can create 

* a ReplicationController that keeps up pods defined in the 
    * DeploymentConfig which creates new ReplicationControllers when the
        * ImageStream finds out a new image is uploaded into it by
            * BuildConfig that controls building container images.

## Handmade DeploymentConfig

DeploymentConfig is an object that create ReplicationControllers according to `spec.template`. However, the difference to the ReplicationController is that DeploymentConfig can start new ReplicationController based on state of `spec.triggers`. 

*`deploymentconfig.yaml`*
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: DeploymentCOnfig
metadata:
  labels:
    app: serveapp
  name: blogdeployment
spec:  
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    app: serveapp
    deploymentconfig: blogdeployment
  strategy:
    activeDeadlineSeconds: 21600
    type: Rolling
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: serveapp
        deploymentconfig: blogdeployment
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: serve-cont
        image: "serveimagestream:latest"
  triggers:
  - type: ConfigChange 
  - imageChangeParams:
      automatic: true
      containerNames:
      - serve-cont
      from:
        name: serveimagestream:latest
    type: ImageChange
```

In this case, the DeploymentConfig object will listen to *ImageStream* object `serveimagestream:latest`.

## Handmade ImageStream

ImageStreams simplify image names and get triggered by a BuildConfig if new
images are being uploaded to the registry. In the case where a new image is
uploaded, it can trigger its listeners to act. In the case of our
DeploymentConfig, action would be to do a rolling update for the pods that it is
meant to deploy.

A simple ImageStream object looks like this:

*`imagestream.yaml`*
```yaml
apiVersion: image.openshift.io/v1
kind: ImageStream
metadata:
  labels:
    app: serveapp
  name: serveimagestream
spec:
  lookupPolicy:
    local: false
```

## Handmade BuildConfig

A BuildConfig objects create container images according to specific rules. In the following example the Docker strategy is used to build trivial extension of `httpd` image shipped with openshift.

```yaml
kind: "BuildConfig"
apiVersion: "v1"
metadata:
  name: "serveimg-generate"
  labels:
    app: "serveapp"
spec:
  runPolicy: "Serial"
  output:
    to:
      kind: ImageStreamTag
      name: serveimagestream:latest
  source:
    dockerfile: |
      FROM docker-registry.default.svc:5000/openshift/httpd
  strategy: 
    type: Docker
```

After creating the build object (here named `serveimg-generate`), we can request openshift cluster to build the image by

```bash
$ oc start-build serveimg-generate
```

# Typical Kubernetes/OpenShift design patterns and objects

## Persistent storage

Persistent storage is requested from the cluster using `PersistentVolumeClaim` objects:

`pvc.yaml`
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: testing-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
  - ReadWriteMany
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi
```

This will request a 1 GiB persistent storage that can be mounted in read-write mode by multiple nodes.

The persistent volume can be mounted to pods as follows:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: mypod-vol
  labels:
    app: serveapp-vol
    pool: servepod-vol
spec:
  containers:
  - name: serve-cont
    image: "docker-registry.default.svc:5000/openshift/httpd"
    volumeMounts: 
    - mountPath: /mountdata
      name: smalldisk-vol
  volumes:
  - name: smalldisk-vol
    persistentVolumeClaim:
      claimName: testing-pvc
```

## InitContainer

*InitContainer* is a container in a pod that is run to completion before the main containers are started. Data from init containers are most easily transfered to the main container using volume mounts

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: mypod
  labels:
    app: serveapp
    pool: servepod
spec:
  volumes: 
  - name: sharevol
    emptyDir: {}
  initContainers:
  - name: perlhelper
    image: perl
    command:
    - sh
    - -c
    - >
      echo Hello from perl helper > /datavol/index.html
    volumeMounts:
    - mountPath: /datavol
      name: sharevol
  containers:
  - name: serve-cont
    image: docker-registry.default.svc:5000/openshift/httpd
    volumeMounts:
    - mountPath: /var/www/html
      name: sharevol
```

Here we run init container from image perl which echoes stuff to file `index.html` on the shared volume. 

The shared volume is defined in `spec.volumes` and "mounted" in `spec.initContainers.volumeMounts` and `spec.containers.volumeMounts`.

## Jobs

*Jobs* are in a sense run-to-completion Pods, except that they operate on the same level as ReplicationControllers, in a sense that they too define template for pod to be launched instead of directly describing the pod. The difference is, however, that *Jobs* are not restarted when they finish.

```yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: pi
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      volumes:
      - name: smalldisk-vol
        emptyDir: {}
      containers:
      - name: pi
        image: perl
        command:
        - sh
        - -c
        - >
          echo helloing so much here! Lets hello from /mountdata/hello.txt too: &&
          echo hello to share volume too >> /mountdata/hello-main.txt &&
          cat /mountdata/hello.txt
        volumeMounts: 
        - mountPath: /mountdata
          name: smalldisk-vol
      restartPolicy: Never
      initContainers:
      - name: init-pi
        image: perl
        command: 
        - sh
        - -c
        - >
          echo this hello is from the initcontainer >> /mountdata/hello.txt
        volumeMounts: 
        - mountPath: /mountdata
          name: smalldisk-vol
  backoffLimit: 4
```


# A minimal introduction to YAML files

YAML is used to describe key-value maps and arrays. You can recognize YAML file from `.yml` or `.yaml` file suffix.

A YAML dataset can be

1. Value

    ```yaml
    value
    ```

2. Array
    ```yaml
    - value 1
    - value 2
    - value 3
    ```
    or
    ```yaml
    [value 1, value 2, value 3]
    ```

3. Unordered map
    ```yaml
    key: value
    another_key: another value
    ```
    or
    ```yaml
    key:
      value
    another_key:
      another value
    ```

Now the real kicker is: value can be a YAML dataset!

```yaml
key:
  - value 1
  - value 2
  another key:
    yet another key: value of yak
  another keys lost sibling:
    - more values
  this key has one value which is array too:
  - so indentation is not necessary here since keys often contain arrays
```

You can do multiline values:

```yaml
key: >
  Here's a value that is written over multiple lines
  but is actually still considered a single line until now.

  Placing double newline here will result in newline in the actual data.
```

Or if you want *verbatim* kind of style:
```yaml
key: |
  Now the each
  newline is
  treated as such so
```
